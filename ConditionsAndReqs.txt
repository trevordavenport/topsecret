ASSUME
conditions for assume expr:
  1) assume must follow show
	2) expr must be the negation of the preceding show's expr or the left side of
	   the preceding show's implication
	   Ex.:
	   show (p=>z)
	   assume p    // valid
	   assume ~p // invalid
	   
	   Ex.:
	   show a
	   assume ~a // valid
	   assume b // invalid
	
USER INPUT   
there are two valid patterns for user input.
they are:

	print // alone on line
	<reason> <expr(s)> // <expr(s)> might be multiple expressions separated
					   // by whitespace
					   
	valid reason syntax:
		show <expr>
		assume <expr> // see above for special assume conditions
					  // there must be a white space between assume and <expr>
		<mp/mt/co> <line #> <line #>
				      // there must be a white space between the reason and
				      // each line #
		<ic/repeat> <line #>
		<theorem> <line #>
					  // <theorem> is only valid if TheoremSet contains it
					  // <theorem> CANNOT be one of "print", "show", "assume", 
					  	 "mp", "mt", "co", "ic", or "repeat"
					  
	REQUIREMENTS FOR <line #> (see above for where <line #> is used):
		<line #> must refer to a line label already used
		
		because inferences are not allowed to refer to the INTERIOR steps of a
		previous subproof, valid line #'s are NEVER longer than the current line,
		and you can only reference a subroutine line number of the same section
		
		Ex.:
			current line #: 3.2.4
			valid line references: 1, 2, 3.1, 3.2.1, 3.2.2, 3.2.3
			invalid example: 3.2.1 (<-- part of a different subproof!)
			
	VALID EXPRESSION SYNTAX:
		a variable (lower-case letter) is an expression
		
		if E is an expression, ~E is an expression
	
		if E1 and E2 are expressions, (then E1&E2) and (E1|E2) are expressions
		
		if E1 and E2 are expressions, then (E1=>E2) is an expression 
		
		These statements can build on one another to form compound expressions.
		
		CONDITIONS:
			Expressions CANNOT contain whitespace
			
			Expressions MUST enclose all use of logical operators (&, |, =>) with
			parentheses!
			
LINE NUMBER REQUIREMENTS:
	
	LINE CONTINUATION:
		case 1:
			Immediately following a "show", the line number is the line number of the "show"
			with a ".1" appended.
			Subsequent lines continue with ".2", ".3", etc. until another "show", which
			initiates another subproof
			
		case 2:
			a step is given ON THE SAME LEVEL AS THE "show",
			in which the inferred expression is equal to show's operand.
			Line numbering then continues with the number after the "show"'s line number.
			
		SPECIAL CASE:
			the line number immediately following line 1 (a "show" reason) is 2.
			
VALID ASSUMPTIONS:
	the file of theorems named in the CLI is free of errors
	
MISCELLANEOUS REQUIREMENTS:
	All data fields and methods within each class should have the appropriate public/private/
	package/protected qualifier
		-- Code CANNOT make things public that would allow a non-inheriting user to corrupt
		   data -- EVEN IF OUR CODE DOES NOT DO THIS
		   
	For each nontrivial class besides ProofChecker.java, there should be a matching JUnit class
